Female bed bugs lay one to five eggs per day. Bed\nbugs grow to full adulthood in about 21 days.\n3. Bed bugs can survive for months without feeding.\n4. Bed Bug Bites: Because bed bugs usually feed at night, most people are bitten in their sleep and do not realize they were bitten.\nA person's reaction to insect bites is an immune response and so varies from person to person. Sometimes the red welts caused\nby the bites will not be noticed until many days after a person was bitten, if at all.\n5. Common signs and symptoms of a possible bed bug infestation:\n\u25cf Small red to reddish brown fecal spots on mattresses, box springs, bed frames, mattresses, linens, upholstery, or walls.\n\u25cf Molted bed bug skins, white, sticky eggs, or empty eggshells.\n\u25cf Very heavily infested areas may have a characteristically sweet odor."
